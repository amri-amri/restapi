Make sure to check out http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/
in order to use the API per a GUI.
The *RESTfulAPIApplication* has to be running for that, of course.
And make sure that the *MySQL Server* is running, as well.

== Database Controller
This controller can be used to interact with the MySQL database.
It provides GET, POST & DELETE endpoints.

=== GET
Available endpoints are :

* `get/log`
* `get/log/{logID}`
* `get/trace/{traceID}`

To get a *list of all logs* present in the database, a simple GET
request `get/log` can be performed.

---
To get **a certain log** the GET request `get/log/{logID}` can
be performed, where `{logID}` is the UUID of the log.
The response from the GET request above contains all logIDs.

==== trace

To get **a certain trace** the GET request `get/trace/{traceID}` can
be performed, where `{traceID}` is the UUID of the trace.

include::{snippets}/../target/snippets/200/get/trace/traceID_0/curl-request.adoc[]
.HTTP Response
include::{snippets}/../target/snippets/200/get/trace/traceID_0/http-response.adoc[]

The `get/log/{logID}` and `get/trace/{traceID}` requests fail if the
respective ID is not present in the database.

include::{snippets}/../target/snippets/404/get/log/logID/http-response.adoc[]

---
=== POST

To insert a log and its traces into the database, a POST request
`post/log` should be performed. The request body should contain
a String which contains the XES of the log.

.HTTP
include::{snippets}/../target/snippets/200/post/log/http-request.adoc[]
.HTTPIE
include::{snippets}/../target/snippets/200/post/log/httpie-request.adoc[]
.CURL
include::{snippets}/../target/snippets/200/post/log/curl-request.adoc[]
.HTTP Response
include::{snippets}/../target/snippets/200/post/log/http-response.adoc[]

The request fails if the XES document is not valid.

.HTTP Response
include::{snippets}/../target/snippets/400/post/log/http-response.adoc[]

If the XES is valid however, every substring with prefix __"<trace"__ and suffix
__"</trace>"__ is extracted from the document and inserted in the database as
a trace entry. All that will be left from the original document is an empty
log which will be inserted in the database as a log entry. The trace entries
all reference the logs' ID.

---
=== DELETE

To *set the "removed"-flag of a log to "true"*, a simple DELETE
request `delete/log/{logID}` has to be performed, where `{logID}`
represents the log's UUID.

.HTTP

.CURL
include::{snippets}/../target/snippets/200/delete/log/logID/curl-request.adoc[]
.HTTP Response
include::{snippets}/../target/snippets/200/delete/log/logID/http-response.adoc[]

The request fails if the logID is not present in the database.

== ProCAKE Instance Controller

This controller provides the following endpoints:

* `get/procake/restart`: Restarts the ProCAKE instance.
* `get/procake/reload`: Reloads the traces from the database
into the instances' casebase after converting them to valid
`NESTSequentialWorkflow`-objects.

If the first request is performed, the instances' casebase
will be empty until it has been reloaded.

The responses are Strings containing status messages.

== Retrieval Controller

Retrieval on the casebase can be performed by either chosing
a trace from the database as query object, or providing an XES
in the request body:

* `put/retrieval/{traceID}`
* `put/retrieval`

#The XES has to be a valid log containing
at least one trace. The first trace in that log will then be
the query trace.# Also, the request will fail if the
traceID given per the first method is not present in the database.
The controller will not check if the trace is removed, however.

Please also note, that the #filtering of the casebase has yet to
be implemented#. So all retrieval will be performed on the whole
casebase.

The request body is a JSON of the following structure:

 {
    "xes": "string",
    "globalSimilarityMeasure": "string",
    "globalMethodInvokers": {
        "methods": [
            {
                "name": "string",
                "valueType": "string",
                "value": "string"
            }
        ]
    },
    "localSimilarityMeasureFunc": "string",
    "localMethodInvokersFunc": "string",
    "localWeightFunc": "string",
    "filterParameters": {},
    "numberOfResults": 0
 }

===== xes
This field denotes the query object's XES as a String.
See above for information on the XES document.
The value of this field is irrelevant if a `traceID` is given
in the PUT request.

These fields' value can be `null` (without quotation marks,
see snippets below).

===== globalSimilarityMeasure
A String containing the name of the similarity measure
that is to be used on the global scale, meaning from query to
case object.

These fields' value can be `null`.

===== globalMethodInvokers
This fields' value is another field _"methods"_, which represents
a list of objects that each have a

* _"name"_, a
* _"valueType"_, and a
* _"value"_ field.

The value of _"name"_ is the name of a method that is implemented
by the similarity measure denoted by _"globalSimilarityMeasure"_
*without any modifiers or parameter types*. _"valueType"_ denotes
the class of the parameter which can only be `"string"`,
`"double"`, or `"boolean"`. Other data types have not been
implemented yet. If the data type is none of the above,
that `method` object corresponds to a method without any parameters.
Methods that accept more than one argument are not implemented (yet).
The _"value"_ field denotes the value of the passed argument.

This fields' value can be `null`.

===== localSimilarityMeasureFunc, localMethodInvokersFunc & localWeightFunc
These fields should contain XML-representations of the respective
functional interface (`SimilarityMeasureFunc`,
`MethodInvokersFunc` & `WeightFunc`). For more information on
these interfaces and their XML-representations, please read the
documentation of the `procake-extension` module.

These fields' values can be `null`.

===== filterParameters
-- Not implemented yet --

===== numberOfResults
This field's value should be an integer denoting the number of
retrieval results.

---

The response body is a list of `traceID`-`similarity value` pairs.
